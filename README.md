# Fifa22 Web Application: A react.JS project

Some important points to mention-

1. React.JS is used for frontend,
2. The website is responsive,
3. Different types of CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, tailwind, material UI, etc.) is not used.

## Additional library Installation

1. I used React-router-dom to go from one page to another. You have to type "npm install react-router-dom" in the terminal before running the app using vscode.
2. I also used React-chart-js2 for the radar chart. You have to type "npm install --save react-chartjs-2 chart.js" in the terminal before running the app using vscode.


## Part 1: Search Page
As mentioned in the assignment details, user should be able to search for a player using one of his attributes (3 attributes is used and you can search using any one of them) apart from his name. So, I took the attributes "Nationality", "Club", and "Position". Now, if you search using the "Position" (suppose, you typed "lw" which means left winger one of the positions, Neymar Jr name will show in the result bar). Similarly, for the "Nationality" and "Club". 

## Part 2: Player Profile Page (Cristiano Ronaldo)
From the search results, if you click on Cristiano Ronaldo, the webapp will take you to another page, where you will see all kind of informations regarding Cristiano Ronaldo's different playing abilities (Radar Chart) and other necessary informations.
